#     %F_CPU%	will be replaced by the value of the CPU Clock Rate entered through the GUI
#     %CPU%     will be replaced by the value of the CPU entered through the GUI
#     %ALNAME%  is the name of the source file being compiled with the .c extension replaced by .al

# Note:  the flag -save-temps=obj does not appear to be a valid flag for win32.  Omit the "=obj".
